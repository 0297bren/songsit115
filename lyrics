because I want to see people and I want to see the light
where there's music and there's people who are young and alive

You kept to yourself
I couldn't find you
A sign of the times
Because you walked the line
I'm over the act
I couldn't tempt you
I numbed my brain
As you unclogged the drain
Now run it

driving in your car
I never want to go home

You're still haunting me
It sounds unfounded
Although it's apathy
What goes around you see
Breaks the boundaries
Walk with a smile
And it's all just a style
Since you put me on trial today

Becae It's not my home, its their home and I'm welcome no more
And if a double decker bus

Why should I just walk away
For you to come around another day?
Waiting for the time we will collide
When I meet you on the other side

crashed into us
 to die by your side,
 is such a heavenly way to die
 
Ships in the night
Right in front of me
Accepted your slight
Though your answer was trite
I reached for the phone
But couldn't vent to you
I numbed my brain
As you unclogged the drain
Now run it

Take me out Tonight
take me anywhere
I dont care I doint care
