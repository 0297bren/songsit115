because I want to see people and I want to see the light
where there's music and there's people who are young and alive

You kept to yourself
I couldn't find you
A sign of the times
Because you walked the line
I'm over the act
I couldn't tempt you
I numbed my brain
As you unclogged the drain
Now run it

driving in your car
I never want to go home

You're still haunting me
It sounds unfounded
Although it's apathy
What goes around you see
Breaks the boundaries
Walk with a smile
And it's all just a style
Since you put me on trial today
